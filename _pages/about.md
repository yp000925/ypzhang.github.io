Hi, my name is Yunping (Sherry), currently a 3rd year PhD student from the department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at [the University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/), supervised by [Prof.Edmund Y. Lam](https://www.eee.hku.hk/~elam/). 
My research interest includes but not restricted to digital holography, computational imaging, Poisson denoising and processing.  

## My background and history
Before coming to Hong Kong, I obtained my B.S. degree in Electronic and Electrical Engineering from [the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/) and M.S. degree with distinction from the [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/).
