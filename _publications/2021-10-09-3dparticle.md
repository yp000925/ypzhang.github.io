3D micro-particle field reconstruction with high accuracy and low latency is an ambitious and important task within various applications. Without using any focusing optics, the digital holography (DH) is used as a high throughput and compact imaging system to retrieve the particle 3D distribution information from two-dimensional(2D) gray-scale interference pattern. In this work, a one-stage digital in-line holography model is proposed with competitive performance in localisation accuracy and extraction rate with improved processing speed. This model facilitates the analysis of the dynamic displacements and motions for micro particles or cells and could be further extended to various types of computational imaging problems sharing the similar traits.
