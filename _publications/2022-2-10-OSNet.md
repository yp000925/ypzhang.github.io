Volumetric reconstruction of a three-dimensional (3D) particle field with high resolution and low latency is an ambitious and valuable task. As a compact and high-throughput imaging system, digital holography (DH) encodes the 3D information of a particle volume into a two-dimensional (2D) interference pattern. In this work, we propose a one-stage network (OSNet) for 3D particle volumetric reconstruction. Specifically, by a single feed-forward process, OSNet can retrieve the 3D coordinates of the particles directly from the holograms without high-fidelity image reconstruction at each depth slice. Evaluation results from both synthetic and experimental data confirm the feasibility and robustness of our method under different particle concentrations and noise levels in terms of detection rate and position accuracy, with improved processing speed. The additional applications of 3D particle tracking are also investigated, facilitating the analysis of the dynamic displacements and motions for micro-objects or cells. It can be further extended to various types of computational imaging problems sharing similar traits.
